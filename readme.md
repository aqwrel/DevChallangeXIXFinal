## Task description

Your task. Develop a web application in which users can alert people about a potential danger by approaching dangerous items.

To report a dangerous item (e.g. rockets, drones, planes, etc.) at the current location of the user, the user of your application first chooses a type of danger item in a group of buttons, enters the direction of the danger item via swipe/drag gesture and then hits a submit button.

After hitting submit, the application should show:
* the current geoposition of the danger item
* the direction of the danger item
* the city which will be most likely hit by the danger item

To find the city which is in the biggest danger (i.e. most likely to be hit by the danger item), use the direction of the danger item and its distance to the cities in the pool of cities (shared with you as the cities.json file) to compute the most likely flying trajectory of the danger item

Notes:
* It has to be built for modern browsers (we will check your solutions in Chrome)
* Optional: Build the application as a PWA (Progressive Web App).
* ☝️ Championship participants are not allowed to use third-party solutions/libraries, only Vanilla JS or TS. The developer could use Webpack, Parcel or any other bundler.
Design. Example of the design below (ePPO app)
